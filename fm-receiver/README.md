To build an FM receiver using GNU radio  

Make sure that the daughterboard being used with the USRP can be tasked to receive signals at FM frequencies (80 - 120 MHz).  

Run the compiled Python file fm_receiver.pyc to use the USRP as an FM receiver. Note that it runs with a WBX daughterboard with the antenna connected to the "TX/RX" port.  
    python fm_receiver.pyc
