To decode NOAA signals  

The recorded NOAA signals are stored in the 'recorded' folder.  

In the 'compiled' folder, there are two python files - noaa_gnuradio.pyc and NOAA.py  
1.  
NOAA.py is a Python implementation of decoding NOAA signals. To run this program, go to 'compiled' folder on the terminal and  

        python NOAA.py ../recorded/NOAA17.wav

The above program requires ImageMagick package that can be installed by  

    sudo apt-get install imagemagick

Close 'Figure 1'. Resize and rotate the generated image to see the output.  
2.  
The objective of the assignment is to generate a flowgraph on GNU radio to decode NOAA wav files. Refer the research paper for this purpose - Good luck!  
noaa_gnuradio.pyc is a compiled python file for the same. To run this compiled file,  

        python noaa_gnuradio.pyc ../recorded/090729\ 1428\ noaa-18.wav

This will create output.dat file which must be converted to png format to view the image. This can be done via  

    convert -size 2080x1024 -depth 8 gray:output.dat output.png
Rotate the generated image to see the output.  
3.  
To record NOAA signals on your own, use the GRC file provided. NOAA satellites can be tracked using gpredict software or websites like http://www.n2yo.com/satellites/?c=4
